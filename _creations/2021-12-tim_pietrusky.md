My daughter Nika got a small wodden board a year ago for her birthday that contained a few objects that she could play with and explore different kind of concepts (like pushing a button to turn on a light). In October she started to walk freely (she was 4 back then and it took over a year of hard practise to get her to this point) and to celebrate the new freedom of seeing the world from a totally different perspective (before that she was only crawling) I made a big version of the wodden board that contains: The same LED panel from her small board, a huge red bell for a bicycle, a door lock, a mirror, a toilet roll holder, a huge and a small drain pipe, a huge and a small wheel, the front part of a broom, a red combination lock a reflector and a lock. 

It's mounted on the wall in the living room and she loves to stand there and play around with all the different parts.
