Summer is hot and rainy here in Hong Kong. Instead of pounding the pavement for the next great street photography moment, I just take it easy, pull out my mobile, and take a bunch of shots at these amazing skies. The colors are unbelievable. The clouds add volume and texture. I just point and shoot. Life should be this simple.
